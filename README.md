# Brain_tumor_classification
A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults.
Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors.
Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for
people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and36 percent
for women. Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor,
etc. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve
the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI). A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of
complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.
Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial
Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification. Hence,
proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Machine Learning,Deep
Learning Algorithms using ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
would be helpful to doctors all around the world.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging popularly known as MRI is one of the primary scans to visualize
the brain tumor. The detailed pictures obtained from MRI when processed using deep learning
methods help the neurologist in classifying brain tumors. The paper has extracted features and
also a comparative analysis of different CNN based model for the classification of MRI images
for brain tumors. It shows the efficiency of deep learning techniques for the detection of brain
cancer from the MRI images of the brain. The performance is measured in terms of training
accuracy and test accuracy. Here binary classification is done with no tumor and with tumor
classes. The goal of our study is to accurately detect tumors in the brain and classify it through
the means of several techniques involving medical image processing, pattern analysis, and
computer vision for enhancement, segmentation and classification of brain diagnosis
